##Why this dataset? 
The purpose of a dataset like this is to examine in greater detail who the target audience is for Netflix. From the data the company could make decisions on future content to add to their library. The company can also look at where in the world the majority of their revenue is coming from as well as be able to tell on what devices their content is most popular to be streamed from. Being able to know this information can be critical when making decisions on future improvements to the services and where to add them. 

##Source of Data Set: 
The data was first pulled from analytics on Netflix then posted to Kaggle on July of 2023 by the user ARNAV.

##Any munging, imputation, or feature engineering?
As downloaded the dataset was complete. There was no outliers that did not make sense nor was there modifications needed to be able to make the data useable. The usability is well laid out with easy to read rows and columns that makes filtering and creating methods and visualizations easy.

##What is in the Data Set? 
There is a total of 2500 users collected. The dataset consists of demograplics of each user including their age, gender and country of origin. More information is also available on the subscription tier of each account and the monthly price being paid. Another thing being tracked is the most popular device the account is being used on. 

##How is it filtered?
More data that has been filtered out is the plan duration length. As Netflix does not have any annual or other options in duration length besides monthly this column was left out. The last part of filtering done to the data was the join and last payment dates. After going through the data, it is not relevant to the questions that are going to be answered.
